This is my Bourbon-Brown-Sugar-Pork-Tenderloin recipe. It's very healthy and delecious to eat. It is an excellent source of protein, thiamine, vitamin B6, phosphorus and niacin and a good source of riboflavin, potassium and zinc.
This pork loin plays pinball on your taste buds, offering the sweetness of brown sugar, the tang of mustard, and the rich smoke flavor of bacon (the bacon also helps keep the meat moist). And just for polish, there’s a Tennessee whiskey glaze.
I’ve written this recipe for a pork loin roast, which is readily available, quick to prepare, and easy to serve.
